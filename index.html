    <h1>Idhant Kumar</h1>
    <p>I'm a third-year Data Science student at UC San Diego, driven by the power of machine learning to solve real-world problems—particularly in finance and fintech. My goal is to pursue graduate studies and deepen my expertise in AI, all while continuing to create small automation tools that make everyday life more efficient. I’m excited to blend data-driven insights with innovative solutions to shape the future of finance.</p>
